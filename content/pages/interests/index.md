Hi! I'm a recent CS grad from [International Institute of Information Technology - Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in/), and I'll soon start working at Capital One as a software engineer. These are some of the interests I've formed over the years, and I hope I'll add a few more soon :).

### Competitive Programming
I started competitive programming in 2018, but only started taking it seriously in 2020, after joining college.
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/): [<span style="color:#ff8c00;"> **fangahawk** </span>](https://codeforces.com/profile/fangahawk) (Master, peak <span style="color:#ff8c00;">2113</span>, India #60)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/):[<span style="color:#0000FF;"> **fangahawk** </span>](https://atcoder.jp/users/fangahawk) (peak <span style="color:#0000ff;">1800</span>, India #55)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/): [<span style="color:#FF7F00;"> **fangahawk** </span>](https://www.codechef.com/users/fangahawk) (peak <span style="color:#ff7f00;">2206</span>)

In ICPC, I competed with my team [fightFight](https://icpc.global/ICPCID/TZ9TTE89PS7A). Our biggest achievements include ranking #19 at the Asia-West Finals 2022, and ranking #9 in the Amritapuri Regional 2023, but we weren't able to achieve the dream of going to World Finals (missed it by the barest of margins).\
I've also been the [IIIT Programming Club](https://iiit-programming-club.github.io/) coordinator, where I helped organize contests like Botomania, Decode, and Vimgolf, and also led the organization and problem setting of [Codeforces Round 940 (Div. 2) and CodeCraft-23](https://codeforces.com/contest/1957) which had ~30k participants on Codeforces. I authored two problems in this contest, [A BIT of an Inequality](https://codeforces.com/contest/1957/problem/D) and [Frequency Mismatch](https://codeforces.com/contest/1957/problem/F2).\
I've always been more of a generalist in competitive programming, solving completely random problems for fun & practice. However, I've specifically loved problems that involve Suffix Arrays, Persistent Data Structures, Combinatorics, Probablity/Expected Value & Number Theory.
### Teaching
I love to teach! In college, I've been a Teaching Assistant for Discrete Math, Design & Analysis of Algorithms, and Advanced Algorithms.\
I've also taken a couple of meets on competitive programming too. I've taken meets on Number Theory, XOR basis, Suffix Arrays, and Persistent Data Structures when I was in college.
### Systems
I was a part of the Computer Systems Group at IIIT-H as an undergraduate researcher, where I worked on optimizing the STAR DNA Sequence Aligner in collaboration Intel Labs.\

I have a few systems-related projects that I've worked on.
- Optimized Needleman-Wunsch to achieve a 33x performance increase using SIMD & parallelization with Kishore Kumar. [Link](https://github.com/akcube/Sewing-machine)
- Built a Distributed File System with semantics similar to Google File System and Hadoop File System with Dheeraja Rajreddygari, Kushagra Kharbanda, Pramod Rao. [Link](https://github.com/PramodRaoB/hybrid-distributed-file-system)
- Designed a compiler for Racket to x86asm compilation, including support for functions, conditional branching and loops with Shavak Kansal. [Link](https://github.com/Vidit-Jain/racket-compiler)
- Extended a realational database design with specialized page design for matrices to improve efficiency, and optimizing joins & group by queries using indexing with the help of B+ Trees with Dheeraja Rajreddygari, Pramod Rao. [Link](https://github.com/Vidit-Jain/relational-db)

### Theory
I loved learning about algorithms, and understanding their proofs and bounds, which may be related to my interest in Competitive Programming.
Most of my favorite courses in college have been more theory-heavy courses, like Complexity Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Advanced Algorithms, and an independent study on Scheduling Theory.

### Gaming
I've started gaming when I was 7 years old, starting off with the original Xbox. Since then, I've played a variety of games on PC and console, but I've loved Racing, Shooting and Open World games.\
Since 2016, I've been addicted to just playing Dota 2, in which I have 3500+ hours. Funnily enough, the only reason I started playing Dota 2 over League of Legends is a bug with the League installer which prevented me from installing the game.\
I haven't played a lot of different games since 2016, but I hope start trying more soon :).

### Cricket
I'm an avid cricket fan, and love watching nearly every match that India and RCB play.\
Whenever I'm bored, I usually just start finding random stats and articles related to cricket. Although I don't play it much, I do like to bowl a bit of pace from time to time, not very pacey though :(.
